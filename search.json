    "text": "Adoptive Cell Therapy and the Microbiome\nI am currently working in the lab of Tom Gajewski, MD, PhD, at the University of Chicago, studying the role of the gut microbiome in modulating response to adoptive T cell therapy. I am using a couple of different models, including a transgenic mouse model with live biotherapeutic products. Our goal is to identify specific microbial taxa and metabolites that can enhance anti-tumor immunity and improve treatment outcomes.\n\n\n\nDifferential stool species among CAR-T recipients\n\n\n\n\nMachine Learning for CAR-T Outcomes\nI currently lead an ongoing CIBMTR study, prediciting response and toxicity for patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with CD19 CAR-T therapy. This study is aimed at identifying clinical and molecular biomarkers that can help guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. It leverages a large multi-national database to ensure robust and generalizable findings.\n\n\n\nMachine learning ensemble stack\n\n\n\n\nClinical Trial: Lactulose and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors\nI recently wrote a Phase I/II clinical trial that investigates the addition of lactulose to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Phase I is tumor agnostic, focusing on the stool microbial and metabolomic changes while Phase II is focused on ICI-refractory melanoma and objective response rate. The trial aims to evaluate whether modulating the gut microbiome with lactulose can enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy and improve patient outcomes.\n\n\n\nClinical trial schema"

    "text": "My name is Reid Shaw and I grew up in Seattle, WA. I am the younger brother of Hale and favorite son of Bill and Laura. For college, I attended Whitman College in Walla Walla, WA, where I studied Biophysics, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology and played soccer with my friends (Junpei and Jesse). After graduating in 2014, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, focusing on functional genomics. I then followed my PI, Dr. Carla Grandori, to her start-up company, SEngine Precision Medicine, where we (including my other friends Hallie and Rob) built a CLIA-certified platform to test cancer drugs on patient-derived organoids. I then pursued my MD at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, graduating in 2021. Following medical school, I completed my residency in Internal Medicine at Loyola University Medical Center. I am currently a Hematology and Oncology Fellow at the University of Chicago.\nIn my free time, I enjoy eating pizza, and playing basketball and soccer. I am engaged to Miriam Haxton who is the most amazing Psychiatrist. I met her in medical school and we moved to Chicago together for residency where we currently live."
