I am the younger brother of Hale and favorite son of Bill and Laura. For college, I attended Whitman College in Walla Walla, WA, where I studied Biophysics, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology and played soccer with my friends (Junpei and Jesse). After graduating in 2014, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, focusing on functional genomics. I then followed my PI, Dr. Carla Grandori, to her start-up company, SEngine Precision Medicine, where we (including my other friends Hallie and Rob) built a CLIA-certified platform to test cancer drugs on patient-derived organoids. I then pursued my MD at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, graduating in 2017. Following medical school, I completed my residency in Internal Medicine at Loyola University Medical Center. I am currently a Hematology and Oncology Fellow at the University of Chicago.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy eating pizza, and playing basketball and soccer.
