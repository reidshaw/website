Our goal is to identify specific microbial taxa and metabolites that can enhance anti-tumor immunity and improve treatment outcomes.\n\n\n\nDifferential stool species among CAR-T recipients\n\n\n\n\nMachine Learning for CAR-T Outcomes\nI currently lead an ongoing CIBMTR study, prediciting response and toxicity for patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with CD19 CAR-T therapy. This study is aimed at identifying clinical and molecular biomarkers that can help guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. It leverages a large multi-national database to ensure robust and generalizable findings.\n\n\n\nMachine learning ensemble stack\n\n\n\n\nClinical Trial: Lactulose and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors\nI recently wrote a Phase I/II clinical trial that investigates the addition of lactulose to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Phase I is tumor agnostic, focusing on the stool microbial and metabolomic changes while Phase II is focused on ICI-refractory melanoma and objective response rate.
